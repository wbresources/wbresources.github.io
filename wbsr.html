        <h1>Student Rules</h1>

        <p style="color:white; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"> It is important to understand that since Workbench is not a physical school where the students spend 7-8 hours inside the school campus. It is necessary to have parents&rsquo; involvement in this mode of education. The following rules are our efforts to maximize effective learning and to deter students becoming lazy and Allah&rsquo;s aid is sought. These rules will be explained to the students by the admin.</p>
        
        <h2>
        Homeworks, classworks, and daily planners General Submission Rules:</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>All submissions are done via the MS Teams application chat feature as an attachment. </li>
            <li>Classworks are to be submitted on the same day before 5 PM (UAE time) to the respective subject teacher and the admin. </li>

        <p style="color:white; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">All submissions are to be scanned clearly and converted into a .PDF file with the standard label.</p>
        
        <h2>Guidelines for labeling homework files:</h2>
        
        <ul><li>Type the label while posting the file. </li>
            <li> Use two-digit date for days, &amp; month except for year, i.e., four digits &bull;</li>
            <li>There is a space after each fragment.</li>
            <li>Each subject's first three letters are chosen to denote the subject, except ICT. </li>
            <li>For Daily Planner DP. Use CW for Classworks and HW for Homeworks. </li>
         </p>
        
        <h3>Example: <br></h3>
     <b> Labels for Grade 9B </b><br>
       <h4> For Homework </h4>

        DP(A) G9B FOR DD-MM-2022</p>
    </ul>
        <p>
        Classworks:</p>
        
        <p style="color:white; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Students of grades 5 and above are required to take down their own notes along with the notes given by the respective subject teacher. Class notes are taken down in a notebook not computer typed. Students can always ask the teacher to wait if you need more time to note down the important points. <br>
         <br></p><p>
        Homeworks:</p>
        
        <p style="color:white; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Homeworks should be done neatly with sincerity. It&rsquo;s important to understand that homeworks are for the students&rsquo; own benefit. Note: We don&rsquo;t want the students to postpone their homeworks until the last moment of submission. Often students end up completing them in a hurry without any benefit. So, we want the students to do their works as soon as possible and if they have any doubt regarding the homework, they need to ask the teacher in the class itself. If the student is not able to submit on time. The subject teacher and the admin must be notified the reason. The admin will then verify this with the parent. Students who submit late or do not submit at all without any genuine reason will be made to redo the same work 5 or more times. Which is then send to the subject teacher and the admin. Marks also will be deducted from the continuous assessment of that term. Recurrent late submissions and no submissions will result in expulsion from the class. Homeworks done badly, hastily, with minimum or no effort at all will be considered as no submission.</p>
