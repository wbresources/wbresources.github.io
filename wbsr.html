       <h3>Classworks:</h3>
        
        <p>Students of grades 5 and above are required to take down their own notes along with the notes given by the respective subject teacher.
             Class notes are taken down in a notebook not computer typed.
             Students can always ask the teacher to wait if you need more time to note down the important points. <br>
         <br></p>
         <h3>Homeworks:</h3>
        
        <p style="color:white; ">Homeworks should be done neatly with sincerity. It&rsquo;s important to understand that homeworks are for the students&rsquo; own benefit. Note: We don&rsquo;t want the students to postpone their homeworks until the last moment of submission. Often students end up completing them in a hurry without any benefit. So, we want the students to do their works as soon as possible and if they have any doubt regarding the homework, they need to ask the teacher in the class itself. If the student is not able to submit on time. The subject teacher and the admin must be notified the reason. The admin will then verify this with the parent. Students who submit late or do not submit at all without any genuine reason will be made to redo the same work 5 or more times. Which is then send to the subject teacher and the admin. Marks also will be deducted from the continuous assessment of that term. Recurrent late submissions and no submissions will result in expulsion from the class. Homeworks done badly, hastily, with minimum or no effort at all will be considered as no submission.</p>
